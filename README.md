# Introduction

For now, it is just the beginning of this project.

Limited implementation without any test case.

Any help is welcome.

# Usage

While using async version, package can only run on python3.5 or above as it uses new key words `async` and `await` for async support.

To install it:

`pip install nswebdav`

Here is [documentation](http://nswebdav.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html "Documentation for nswebdav").

# TODO

Complete more functions.
