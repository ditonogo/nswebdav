# Introduction

This is a python implementation for nutstore(jianguoyun) webdav.

It implements easy-to-use high-level interface and support both sync version and async version.

# Usage

While using async version, package can only run on python3.5 or above as it uses new key words `async` and `await` for async support.

To install it:

`pip install nswebdav`

Here is [documentation](http://nswebdav.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ "Documentation for nswebdav").
